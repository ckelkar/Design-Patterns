PURPOSE: To find the most frequently occuring element(s) in the given .wsdl file and calculate it's frequency.

PERCENT COMPLETE: I believe I have completed 100% of this project.

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE: None.

BUGS: None.

FILES: 
1.Driver.java
2.StringOperations.java
3.FileProcessor.java

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
bingsuns2% java Driver amazon.wsdl.xml 
The most frequently occuring element is ASIN. It appeares 15 times.

TO COMPILE:
1.Extract the files.
2.Trace the folder containing all the required files through commmand 'cd'.
3.Use the command javac *.java to compile all the files.

TO RUN:
Please run as:java Driver <input file path>

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITIES OF DATA STRUCTURES:
1.Hashmap:It contains elements as keys and their occurances as values. 
	a)Time Complexity:  All the elements need to be accessed to know the most frequent element(s). So worst case time complexity is O(n) 		where n is size of hashmap.
	b)Space Complexity: All the elements need to be stored in the hashmap. So hashmap requires n units of space. Space complexity is O(n).

2.Arraylist: It contains most frequent element(s).
	a)Time Complexity: All the elements which are most frequent are need to be accessed. So worst case time complexity is O(m) where m is 		the size of arraylist.
	b)Space Complexity: It is possible that all the elements are the most frequent. So worst case,all the elements need to be stored in  		arraylist. Space complexity is O(m).
